# Don't change my BG color! (DcmBGc!)

## Description
This Geode mod prevents the background color from changing in Geometry Dash by forcing it to stay a solid gray color.

Made with <3. Laugh at my "shit code" if you want to! :p

## Features

- Sets background color to a fixed gray (RGB: 150,150,150)
- Stops all actions that might change the background

## Credits
